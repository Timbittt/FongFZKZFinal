                    <li>Reading</li>
                        <p>Reading is one of my favorite things to do. Just sitting back and relaxing with a good book all day, with no worries or responsibilities. You can experience incredible worlds, step in the shoes of determined characters, and watch them face and overcome impossible challenges. You can discover the wonders of the universe, why it is the way it is and what makes it tick. You can learn about the people who have shaped our world and their experiences. The author can share their greatest joys and sorrows, the very things that make them human, through those sheets of paper. All in all, I look back with nostalgia to reading Jules Verne, Brian Sanderson, The Lord of the Rings, Six of Crows, Tom Sawyer and more, and am eternally grateful for discovering those worlds. Right now I am reading Project Hail Mary.</p>

                    <li>Gardening</li>
                        <p>I wouldn't really call this a hobby of mine, but I would like to try to get into it. I think everyone has some experience with growing plants - I had an aerogarden that would let you grow plants without soil in water with nutrients. I recently moved houses and would love the opportunity to add more life and greenery to my room, grow my own produce, and help nourish and grow life from the tiny specks that are seeds.</p>
