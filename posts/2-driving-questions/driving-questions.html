            <h2>Second Post - Driving Questions</h2>
            <em>Oct 13, 2025</em>
            <br />

            <p>
                Every project requires direction, purpose and a specific issue that it addresses to be successful. A driving question provides these requirements, giving a clear avenue for experimentation. 
                <br />
                After brainstorming potential interests, and creating driving questions for 2 of them, I use AI as a tool to glean feedback and refine them. I used the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro model, providing it the project description, criteria for improvement, and each of the driving questions I brainstormed.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Google Gemini provided some helpful feedback, but there was a lot of repetition and jargon. Additionally, it gave a few suggestions that are unrealistic, such as molding plastic and rubber to engineer new brake pad / tire material. However, it did provide many useful insights and a different perspective that was beneficial for the questions, illustrating the beneficial aspects of AI with human supervision.

        <h3>Final Choice</h3>
        <p>  
            <em>How do different materials affect the absorption of electromagnetic waves, such as Wi-Fi frequencies, and how can their impacts be measured to optimize connectivity?</em>
