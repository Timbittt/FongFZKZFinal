        <strong>Ideas I want to pursue further:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Generating and receiving radio waves.</li>
            <li>Testing the penetration/reflection of radio waves through different materials.</li>
            <li>Building a radio satellite using TV dish parts.</li>
            <li>Designing a prototype for an accessible radio telescope for amateur astronomers.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Ideas from peer feedback I did not consider:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The prototypes and iterations of my product I will need to make: I was more focused on the final product instead of the process needed to get there.</li>
            <li>Creating primary research: I prioritized research needed for creating the physical product. I did not think about undertaking primary research that could be applied to real-world issues relating to my topic.</li>
            <li>Dealing with and combating interference from the environment, which could be applied to astronomy, communications, and radar systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Changes/ideas I will implement:</strong>
        <p>Course of action for creating and testing a radio wave generation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research how to create a radio wave detector and generator</li>
            <li>Research how different materials affect radio waves</li>
            <li>Test the detection with itself and with different materials and thicknesses</li>
            <li>Locate radio waves around the house and determine their sources</li>
            <li>Record results</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Building a radio satellite using TV dish parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research radio waves, look at examples of prototypes other people have created</li>
            <li>Create my own design, taking into consideration the materials at my disposal and budget</li>
            <li>Test the design with real world sources of radio waves, and in different weather conditions</li>
            <li>Use what I’ve learned to design a prototype for a public radio telescope</li>
        </ul>
