                    <p>Reading is one of my favorite things to do. Just sitting back and relaxing with a good book all
                        day, with no worries or responsibilities. You can experience incredible worlds, step in the
                        shoes of determined characters, and watch them face and overcome impossible challenges. You can
                        discover the wonders of the universe, why it is the way it is and what makes it tick. You can
                        learn about the people who have shaped our world and their experiences. The author can share
                        their greatest joys and sorrows, the very things that make them human, through those sheets of
                        paper. All in all, I look back with nostalgia to reading Jules Verne, Brian Sanderson, The Lord
                        of the Rings, Six of Crows, Tom Sawyer and more, and am eternally grateful for discovering those
                        worlds.</p>

                <li><h3>Hiking</h3></li>
                <div style="display: inline-flex;">
                    <p>My family often goes on hiking trips. We drive out to national or provincial parks, like Bronte
                        Creek, or Wasaga Beach. The drive is often long, but the fun on being out in nature, with no
                        worries or stresses is well worth it.</p>

                    <p>Many people look down on screen time, but playing video games, learning, watching interesting
                        videos,
                        and connecting with friends are some of the awesome things you can do with them. Learning to
                        code,
                        building robotics or ardiuno projects and more are some cool things I would like to do more
                        often.

                    <p>
                        I recently stopped playing piano but I'm hoping to get back in. I liked to play video game soundtracks but wasn't really that good. Also, love just lying back and chilling while listening, but don't have a particular style I enjoy. Mostly I listen to songs that were popular a while ago.

                    <p>
                        I don't know how to draw properly, but like doodling just for fun or in class when bored.

                    <p>
                        A really cool way to spend time with friends. I probably spent half of last year playing Risk and Poker with friends. Also have a ton of really cool board games that were gifted to me and would love to play but don't get many chances.

                    <p>
                        I don't play any right now, but enjoy doing them just for fun with friends. Stuff like soccer, basketball, frisbee, and I might join table tennis.

                    <p>I wouldn't really call this a hobby of mine, but I would like to try to get into it. I think
                        everyone
                        has some experience with growing plants - I had an aerogarden that would let you grow plants
                        without
                        soil in water with nutrients. I recently moved houses and would love the opportunity to add more
                        life and greenery to my room, grow my own produce, and help nourish and grow life from the tiny
                        specks that are seeds.</p>
